  details: "<b>Project 1: Study chemical reprogramming based on single cell RNA-seq analysis </b> (co-work with <b>Prof. Hongkui Deng</b>)<br>
  This work was published on <b>Cell Stem Cell</b> at year 2018. I am a <b>co-first author</b> of it.
  <br>Main content : 
  <br>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of chemical reprogramming depicts its trajectory and highlights dynamic intermediate cellular programs resembling early embryonic signatures. 
  <br>My contribution: 
  <br> &hearts; The heterogeneity analysis of all three subgroup cells
  <br> &hearts; Trajectory reconstruction during chemical induced reprogramming for three subgroups
  <br> &hearts; All scatter plots, heatmaps, violin plots, venn and volcano plots
  <br> &hearts; Design and draw the summary figure as well as the the cover (:( not be selected))
  <br> &hearts; Keep in touch with those who want to repeat our analysis work and answer their questions.
  <br><br>
  <b>Project 2: Individual gene based normalization in miRNA-seq</b> (co-work with <b>Prof. Mengqiu Dong</b>)<br>
  We have noticed that various sever biases exist in miRNA-seq data and they can not be eliminated by standard normalized software, like DEseq2. We have built up a novel individual gene based normalization method while others treat all genes as the same. And it turns out performing the best over several popular ways.
  <br>My contribution:
  <br> &hearts; Have finished the analysis of miRNA data from <i>c.elegans</i> by miRDeep2
  <br> &hearts; Built up individual-gene based normalization method
  <br> &hearts; Have compared the normalization results between our method with others
  <br> &hearts; Applied this model to bulk RNA-deq data and it turned out having excellent performance
  <br> &hearts; Work on the manuscript now
  <br><br>
  <b>Project 3: Study reprogrammed human tissues based on single cell RNA-seq analysis </b> (co-work with <b>Prof. Hongkui Deng</b>)<br>
  This work is undergoing. I am fully in charge of  all analysis part and is a <b>co-first author</b> of this work."
