  details: "<b>Project 1: Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of embryonic cells</b> (co-work with <b>Prof. Hongkui Deng</b>)<br>
  Dig out the information hidden behind numerous single cell RNAseq data from embryonic cells.
  Lots of efforts are paid and various tools are used, for instance, monocle v2, tSNE, R, single-cell
  RNAseq pipeline. 
  <br> <br>
  <b>Project 2: Individual gene based normalization in miRNA-seq</b> (co-work with <b>Prof. Mengqiu Dong</b>)<br>
  We have noticed that various serious biases exist in miRNA-seq data and they can not be eliminated
  by normal normalized softwares, like DEseq2. We have built up a novel individual-gene based normalization
  method while others treat all genes as the same. And it turns out performing the best over several popular
  methods.
  <br> &hearts; Have finished the analysis of miRNA data from c. elegans
  <br> &hearts; Built up individual-gene based normalization method
  <br> &hearts; Have compared the normalization results between our method with others
  <br> &hearts; Work on the manuscript now"

  details: "<b>Topic: Individual-based modeling of plasmid dynamics in chemostats and biofilms</b><br>
  Illustrate differences, relationship between narrow host-range and broad host-range plasmids
  with or without compatibility in two-species assemblages both in chemostats and biofilms by mass 
  action and individual-based models.
  <br> &hearts; Finished Mass-action Chemostat Model part including results analyses (using Matlab)
