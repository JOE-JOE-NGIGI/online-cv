  title: <strong><font color="#6e3852" size="3"> Mixed-Reality Cells </font></strong>
  link: "http://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China"
  time: 11/2014-10/2015
  location: Boston, MA, USA
  tagline: "The novel concept of Mixed-Reality Cell, which is a brand-new half-real and half-virtual life 
  system consisted of a genetic oscillator built in E. coli and an e-oscillator simulated in a computer, 
  is proposed in this project. A strongly coupled and synchronized mixed-reality state  could thus be 
  achieved by interactions between the real and the virtual part through an interface device composed 
  of microfluidic chip and chemical/optical modulator.<br>
