- intro:
  description: "iGEM is the abbreviation of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition,
  held by MIT. It is a worldwide synthetic biology competition that encouraged students to work 
  together to solve real-world challenges by building genetically engineered biological systems with 
  standard, interchangeable parts. Student teams design, build and test their projects over the summer 
  and gather to present their work and compete at the annual Jamboree.Teams are also challenged to 
  actively consider, building up wiki, making poster and address the safety, security and environmental 
  implications of their work."

- project:
  title: Mixed-Reality Cells (hardware group leader, 11/2014-10/2015)
  link: "http://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China"
  tagline: "The novel concept of Mixed-Reality Cell, which is a brand-new half-real and half-virtual life 
  system consisted of a genetic oscillator built in E. coli and an e-oscillator simulated in a computer, 
  is proposed in this project. A strongly coupled and synchronized mixed-reality state  could thus be 
  achieved by interactions between the real and the virtual part through an interface device composed 
  of microfluidic chip and chemical/optical modulator."
- project:
  title: Rewirable Circuit (Member, 10/2013-11/2014)
  link: "http://2014.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China"
  tagline: "By designing and implementing a rewirable circuit, this project intends to address problems 
  like overload of the host bacteria and signal crosstalk between circles."
