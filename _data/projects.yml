  tagline: "We intend to create a new method that a whole real life system would fuse with a whole virtual life system. To achieve our goal, we chose oscillation, a typical biological process, to represent life activity. The novel concept of Mixed-Reality Cell, which is a brand-new half-real and half-virtual life system consisted of a genetic oscillator built in <i>E.coli</i> and an e-oscillator simulated in a computer, is proposed in this project. A strongly coupled and synchronized mixed-reality state could thus be achieved by interactions between the real and the virtual part through an interface device composed of microfluidic chip and chemical/optical modulator.

  tagline: "By designing and implementing a rewirable circuit, this project intends to address problems like overload of the host bacteria and signal crosstalk between circles. Instead of merely combining different functional modules, we constructed one integrated processing module with fewer parts by utilizing the common structures between modules. The circuit we designed is a rewirable one and the topological structure of the processing module can be altered to adapt to environmental change. The basic idea is to rewire the connections between parts and devices to implement multiple functions with the help of the site-specific recombination systems.
